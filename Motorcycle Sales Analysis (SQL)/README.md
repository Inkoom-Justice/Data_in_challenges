# Motorcycle Spare Parts Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data for motorcycle spare parts, offering insights into client behavior, seasonal trends, and regional warehouse performance. Using SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database, the analysis identifies key patterns that inform inventory management, payment processing, and client-targeted strategies.

## Files and Data Sources
- **SQL Scripts**: Contains SQL queries used for data analysis.
- **motorcycle_data**: Main dataset with information on sales transactions including order details, payment methods, product lines, and client types.
- **Output Visualizations**: Graphs and charts created for visual data storytelling.

## Key Findings
1. **Client Type Analysis**: Wholesale clients place larger orders, while retail clients make smaller, frequent purchases.
2. **Payment Preferences**: Retail clients prefer credit cards, while wholesale clients favor bank transfers.
3. **Product Line Performance**: "Suspension & Traction" is a top seller, especially in the Central warehouse.
4. **Seasonal Trends**: Sales peak in the summer months, notably June to August.
5. **Warehouse Efficiency**: The Central warehouse leads in both volume and average order value.

## Visualizations
Visual aids in this analysis include bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts, which illustrate findings such as order sizes by client type, payment preferences, product line revenues, and seasonal trends.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed.
   - Load the dataset into PostgreSQL.
   - Configure connection parameters (username, password) in the SQL script.
2. **Running SQL Queries**:
   - Use a SQL editor or Jupyter notebook with SQL extensions to execute the queries.
   - Modify parameters if needed to analyze specific segments of the data.

## Usage
The SQL scripts are designed for exploring motorcycle spare parts data. Key functionalities include:
- Running queries for client behavior insights.
- Evaluating product line performance and seasonal trends.
- Calculating warehouse efficiency.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, here are actionable strategies:
1. **Stocking and Inventory**: Align inventory with seasonal demand, focusing on high-performing product lines.
2. **Payment Optimization**: Offer tailored payment solutions for wholesale and retail clients.
3. **Regional Strategy**: Leverage the Central warehouseâ€™s practices to improve efficiencies in other regions.

## Future Directions
Potential extensions for this project:
- Deeper segmentation by client region.
- Integration of visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) for enhanced graphics.
- Development of a dashboard for real-time monitoring.
