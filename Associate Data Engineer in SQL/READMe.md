# Associate Data Engineering Projects with SQL
Welcome to my repository of SQL projects designed to showcase skills relevant to an Associate Data Engineer position. These projects are a compilation of work demonstrating proficiency in data manipulation, query optimization, data analysis, and database design using SQL.

## Project Overview
Each project within this repository is structured to reflect practical scenarios and challenges commonly faced by data engineers. The projects range from basic SQL queries to complex data modeling and performance tuning, highlighting my ability to handle diverse data engineering tasks.

## Projects List
SQL Basics: A collection of SQL queries demonstrating fundamental operations such as SELECT statements, aggregations, joins, and where clauses.
Data Warehouse Design: An example of designing a star schema for a hypothetical e-commerce company, including SQL scripts for table creation and ETL processes.
Query Optimization: A project focused on improving the performance of SQL queries through indexing, query restructuring, and other optimization techniques.
Data Analysis and Reporting: Utilizing SQL to extract insights from datasets, followed by a report summarizing findings and data-driven recommendations.
Database Administration Basics: Scripts and documentation related to basic database administration tasks, such as backup and recovery, permissions management, and performance monitoring.
## Technologies Used
SQL: The primary language used for database interactions, including data querying, schema creation, and database management tasks.
PostgreSQL/MySQL: Depending on the project, one of these RDBMS systems is used to implement and test SQL scripts.
DBT (Data Build Tool): Utilized in some projects for data transformation and building data models in a more modular and testable manner.
Installation and Usage
Each project folder contains a README.md file with specific instructions on how to set up the environment, execute SQL scripts, and any additional steps required to interact with the project. In general, you will need access to an SQL server (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or similar) to run the scripts.
