# Integer Programming Problem: Maximizing Profit

Using Solver for this integer programming problem, you can find that the maximum profit of $5,050 is obtained when 35 Geometry texts and 50 Calculus texts are produced. 


# Nonlinear Programming Problem
## Decision Variable and Formulas

In this problem, the decision variable is the price of a hamburger. Using this variable, you can write formulas for:

- The price
- The total revenue
- The total cost
- The objective function - total profit

Note that the total revenue is the non-linear part of this problem.

## Solver Solution

Solver finds that the maximum profit of $99,900 is achieved when the price is $3.80 per hamburger. At this price, the demand is approximately 32,000 hamburgers.

## Constraints

There are no constraints in this problem. This is not an issue - use Solver as usual, and simply donâ€™t add any constraints.
