## Dataset - Used Cars
An automotive corporation from India named XYZ wants to enter the country's used-car industry by establishing a local business to compete with its rivals. Since these may differ greatly from the market for new automobiles, they want to understand the factors influencing car pricing and sales. In essence, the company seeks to understand: What factors are important in determining the price of a used car? How well such factors reflect a car's price The consulting company has compiled a sizable dataset of various makes and models of used automobiles available on the market based on several market surveys. The dataset includes the different variables that will be helpful during the analysis phase, Sales ID, name, year, selling price, kilometers traveled, state or province, region, fuel type, owner, mileage, engine, maximum power, and number of seats sold. The data was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com.

This data has no missing values and duplicates so I went straight into the analysis. 
This analysis is in two parts. The first part is about exploration of the dataset and the second part is about visualization.


## Summary of Findings

1. The data contains 2000 sold cars and 5906 unsold cars. Most of the used cars come from the central region. The seller type for most of the cars is individual owners. The descending order of the top three most appearing Car Brand name is Maurti, Hyundai and Mahindra. The descending order of the top three most appearing Car Brand name is Maurti, Hyundai and Mahindra.

2. Most of the cars run on Diesel followed by Petrol (Fuel types). Most of the used car engine are between 1000 and 1500. Most of the cars have Manual transmission. Most cars has mileage between 10 and 20. Most of the cars are 5 seater cars.

3. Top three brand names with highest sum total of selling price of the cars are Maruti, Hyundai and BMW respectively. This means these brand names can be used to predict selling prices. The brand name with the highest number of sold cars also has the highest number of unsold cars. It is same for the second and third. The top three brand names in terms of sold and unsold number of cars are Maruti, Hyundai and Mahindra respectively.
First owner cars have the highest selling price followed by second owner and third. First owner cars are more than any of the remaining owner type cars. The most sold cars are from first owner followed by second owner.

4. Most of the cars have a selling price between 0 and 2000000 (Rs). The selling price with most cars is 300000 (Rs).
Cars that have a higher selling price have a mileage between 10 and 30 with those between 10 and 20 having the highest price. There is a weak negative correlation between mileage and selling_price. Most of the sold and unsold cars fall between the mileage of 10 and 20.

5. Manual transmission cars are often sold as compared to automatic. Manual also happen to the most in stock between the the two. Manual transmission cars have higher selling price than automatic transmission cars.

6. There is a positive correlation between selling price and engine which means cars with higher. Most of the sold cars have engine size between 1000 and 2000. It is the same for unsold cars.

7. Out of the number of sold cars, Diesel using cars has the highest number. This is also true for unsold cars. Diesel using cars have the highest selling price followed by Petrol using cars.

8. The region with the highest sold number of cars is the East, followed by Central, West and South respectively. The region with the highest unsold number of cars is Central followed by West, East and South respectively. This explains the importance of the Regions (East, Central, West, and South) in estimating the price of a car. It demonstrates that the east region had the highest selling price for automobiles; in this area, we can see the existence of an outlier that raises the price to the greatest level. The south region, which also has an outlier, was next.

9. Cars with 5 seats are more than cars with any number of seats. 5 seater cars are mostly sold followed by 7 seater cars. Four seater cars have a highest selling price.

10. Year group 4, (2012 - 2017) and 5, (2018+) have all seller types with individual seller type topping the chart for all five year groups.
